# Course assessment

Students will be assessed on the basis of the following components:

- [30%] One-page summaries of three sessions from the first part of the course. Summaries are to be handed in (physically or electronically) by the following session at the latest;

- [30%] The presentation of a research paper in the second part of the course. Papers will be presented in small groups (2-4 people, depending on the number of attendants);

- [40%] A short research report-like assignment focusing on one of the studies presented in class in the second part of the course. Students must report on a paper they have not presented themselves.


A template for the session summaries can be found here.


A reference document with the questions for the report assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/vini-macuch-silva/intro-to-psycholinguistics/tree/master/materials/Reference-final-assignment.pdf).


The course instructor will upload a one-page summary of each session by the beginning of the following session.
